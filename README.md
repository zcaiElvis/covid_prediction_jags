changes.csv contains "revised" and "reported" columns
- revised: most recent data
- reported: reported case on the given date


Notes:
1. Data was not updated daily for the first few month, instead, it was updated every other day
2. There is no revision history prior to 09-11-2020.
3. I suggest to fill the NA's that happen after 09-11-2020 with the corresponding "revision" data (they are missing because no csv files has that date as the most recent date)
